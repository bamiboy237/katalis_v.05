# Phase 2: UI Implementation

**Status:** üü° In Progress - 80% Complete  
**Started:** July 18, 2025  
**Target Duration:** 4 Days

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WORKFLOW INFORMATION

**Figma Wireframes Available:** User has prepared wireframes for all screens/components

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Before implementing any screen/component:** Ask user to upload relevant Figma wireframe
2. **Discuss the design:** Review wireframe details, layout, interactions, and requirements
3. **Then implement:** Build the Compose component/screen based on discussed design
4. **Iterate if needed:** Make adjustments based on feedback

**DO NOT** implement UI components without first seeing and discussing the wireframe!

---

## Objective

To translate the Figma wireframes into a complete library of stateless Jetpack Compose components
and screens.

### Subject Chapter Screen Implementation ‚úÖ

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete Material 3 theme system implemented
- [x] Core navigation screens match Figma wireframes exactly
- [x] Components are reusable and follow design system
- [x] Navigation flows work as designed for implemented screens
- [x] UI integrates properly with mock data system

- [ ] Complete app flow from onboarding to lesson completion

## Design-First Workflow (Established ‚úÖ)

1. **Screen/Component Selection:** Choose what to implement next
2. **Wireframe Request:** Ask user to upload relevant Figma design
3. **Design Discussion:** Review layout, colors, typography, interactions
4. **Implementation:** Build Compose components matching wireframe
5. **Validation:** Compare implementation against original design
6. **Iteration:** Refine based on feedback if needed

## Next Steps

**Ready for next wireframe implementation:**

1. **Request next screen wireframe** (Results Screen, Chat Screen, or Profile Screen)
2. **Continue component library expansion** based on remaining wireframes
3. **Integrate real database** when available to replace mock data system
4. **Polish animations and transitions** between screens

## Notes

- **Design fidelity achieved** - implemented screens match wireframes exactly
- **Reusable component library** established with consistent patterns
- **Mock data system** enables parallel development without database dependency
- **Navigation patterns** established for scalable screen addition
- **Build verification** confirms all components compile successfully
- Material 3 theme provides solid foundation for all UI components
