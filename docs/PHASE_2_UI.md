# Phase 2: UI Implementation

**Status:** üü° In Progress  
**Started:** July 18, 2025  
**Target Duration:** 4 Days

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WORKFLOW INFORMATION

**Figma Wireframes Available:** User has prepared wireframes for all screens/components

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Before implementing any screen/component:** Ask user to upload relevant Figma wireframe
2. **Discuss the design:** Review wireframe details, layout, interactions, and requirements
3. **Then implement:** Build the Compose component/screen based on discussed design
4. **Iterate if needed:** Make adjustments based on feedback

**DO NOT** implement UI components without first seeing and discussing the wireframe!

---

## Objective

To translate the Figma wireframes into a complete library of stateless Jetpack Compose components
and screens.

## Task Checklist

### Step 2.1: Implement the Theme ‚úÖ

- [x] **Material Theme Builder Integration:** Complete Material 3 theme from Theme Builder
- [x] `Color.kt` - Full color palette with light/dark themes and contrast variants
- [x] `Type.kt` - Typography system with serif display fonts and default body fonts
- [x] `Theme.kt` - Complete theme implementation with dynamic color support
- [x] **Theme Integration:** Updated MainActivity to use `KatalisTheme`
- [x] **Build Verification:** All theme components compile successfully

### Step 2.2: Build the Component Library ‚è∏Ô∏è

- [ ] **Process:** For each component, request Figma wireframe first
- [ ] Create files like `Cards.kt`, `Buttons.kt`, etc. based on designs
- [ ] Build stateless Composable functions matching wireframe specs
- [ ] Use `@Preview` annotations extensively for validation
- [ ] Ensure components are self-contained and reusable

### Step 2.3: Assemble the Screens ‚è∏Ô∏è

- [ ] **Process:** For each screen, request Figma wireframe first
- [ ] Discuss layout, navigation, and interaction patterns
- [ ] Create main Composable functions (stateful)
- [ ] Integrate with repository data via ViewModels
- [ ] Build stateless "content" Composables using component library

### Step 2.4: Implement Navigation ‚è∏Ô∏è

- [ ] **Process:** Review Figma navigation flow first
- [ ] Create sealed class `Screen(val route: String)` for all destinations
- [ ] Create `NavGraph.kt` file with proper routing
- [ ] Implement `NavHost` Composable based on wireframe flow

## Prerequisites

- [x] Phase 1 completed successfully - data layer ready
- [x] Figma wireframes prepared and accessible
- [x] **Material 3 Theme:** Complete theme system implemented
- [ ] Design system specifications clarified
- [ ] Navigation flow documented

## Theme Implementation Details

**üé® Color Palette:**

- Primary: Teal-based (#00677C) with light background (#F5FAFD)
- Complete Material 3 semantic color system
- Light/dark themes with medium and high contrast variants
- Dynamic color support for Android 12+

**üìù Typography:**

- Display/Headlines: Serif fonts for elegant headers
- Body/Labels: Default system fonts for readability
- Complete Material 3 typography scale

**‚ö° Features:**

- Automatic dark/light theme switching
- Dynamic color support (Android 12+)
- Full accessibility compliance
- Build-time theme validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete Material 3 theme system implemented
- [ ] All screens match Figma wireframes exactly
- [ ] Components are reusable and follow design system
- [ ] Navigation flows work as designed
- [ ] UI integrates properly with data layer
- [ ] All screens are responsive and accessible

## Design-First Workflow

1. **Screen/Component Selection:** Choose what to implement next
2. **Wireframe Request:** Ask user to upload relevant Figma design
3. **Design Discussion:** Review layout, colors, typography, interactions
4. **Implementation:** Build Compose components matching wireframe
5. **Validation:** Compare implementation against original design
6. **Iteration:** Refine based on feedback if needed

## Next Steps

**Ready for wireframe-driven development:**

1. Request first wireframe (main screen/dashboard?)
2. Discuss design specifications and requirements
3. Build component library based on wireframe designs
4. Implement screens using the design system

## Notes

- Design fidelity is critical - match wireframes exactly
- Build reusable components before complex screens
- Test on different screen sizes during development
- Maintain design system consistency across all components
- Material 3 theme provides solid foundation for all UI components
