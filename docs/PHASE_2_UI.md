# Phase 2: UI Implementation

**Status:** üü° In Progress - 50% Complete  
**Started:** July 18, 2025  
**Target Duration:** 4 Days

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WORKFLOW INFORMATION

**Figma Wireframes Available:** User has prepared wireframes for all screens/components

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Before implementing any screen/component:** Ask user to upload relevant Figma wireframe
2. **Discuss the design:** Review wireframe details, layout, interactions, and requirements
3. **Then implement:** Build the Compose component/screen based on discussed design
4. **Iterate if needed:** Make adjustments based on feedback

**DO NOT** implement UI components without first seeing and discussing the wireframe!

---

## Objective

To translate the Figma wireframes into a complete library of stateless Jetpack Compose components
and screens.

### Step 2.4: Implement Navigation ‚úÖ

- [x] **Navigation Graph:** Complete routing system with parameter support
- [x] **Screen Routes:** Sealed class system for type-safe navigation
- [x] **Deep Linking:** Parameter-based navigation for Subject Chapter screens
- [x] **Integration:** All implemented screens connected through navigation

## Prerequisites

- [x] Phase 1 completed successfully - data layer ready
- [x] Figma wireframes prepared and accessible
- [x] **Material 3 Theme:** Complete theme system implemented
- [x] **Mock Data System:** Placeholder data structure for development
- [x] **Navigation Flow:** Core navigation patterns established

## Recently Completed Work

### Subject Chapter Screen Implementation ‚úÖ

**Components Built:**

- **TopicCard:** Interactive card component displaying individual topics with completion check marks
- **SubjectCard:** Expandable cards for subject selection with visual state feedback
- **ChapterDropdownOverlay:** Full-screen modal overlay for chapter selection from subjects

**Screens Implemented:**

- **SubjectChapterScreen:** Complete screen matching Figma wireframes with:
    - Dynamic title based on selected chapter
    - Topic list with completion indicators
    - Loading, error, and empty states
    - Proper navigation integration
- **SyllabusScreen:** Subject listing screen with dropdown functionality

**Navigation Integration:**

- Parameter-based routing: `subject_chapter/{subjectId}/{chapterId}`
- Complete navigation flow: Syllabus ‚Üí Dropdown ‚Üí Subject Chapter
- Back navigation and state management

**State Management:**

- **SubjectChapterViewModel:** Mock data integration with loading states
- **Mock Data System:** Comprehensive placeholder data for development
- Error handling and edge case management

**Build Status:** All components compile successfully - BUILD SUCCESSFUL

## Theme Implementation Details

**üé® Color Palette:**

- Primary: Teal-based (#00677C) with light background (#F5FAFD)
- Complete Material 3 semantic color system
- Light/dark themes with medium and high contrast variants
- Dynamic color support for Android 12+

**üìù Typography:**

- Display/Headlines: Serif fonts for elegant headers
- Body/Labels: Default system fonts for readability
- Complete Material 3 typography scale

**‚ö° Features:**

- Automatic dark/light theme switching
- Dynamic color support (Android 12+)
- Full accessibility compliance
- Build-time theme validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete Material 3 theme system implemented
- [x] Core navigation screens match Figma wireframes exactly
- [x] Components are reusable and follow design system
- [x] Navigation flows work as designed for implemented screens
- [x] UI integrates properly with mock data system
- [x] All screens are responsive and accessible
- [ ] Complete app flow from onboarding to lesson completion

## Design-First Workflow (Established ‚úÖ)

1. **Screen/Component Selection:** Choose what to implement next
2. **Wireframe Request:** Ask user to upload relevant Figma design
3. **Design Discussion:** Review layout, colors, typography, interactions
4. **Implementation:** Build Compose components matching wireframe
5. **Validation:** Compare implementation against original design
6. **Iteration:** Refine based on feedback if needed

## Next Steps

**Ready for next wireframe implementation:**

1. **Request next screen wireframe** (Lesson Screen, Quiz Screen, or Article View Screen)
2. **Continue component library expansion** based on remaining wireframes
3. **Integrate real database** when available to replace mock data system
4. **Polish animations and transitions** between screens

## Notes

- **Design fidelity achieved** - implemented screens match wireframes exactly
- **Reusable component library** established with consistent patterns
- **Mock data system** enables parallel development without database dependency
- **Navigation patterns** established for scalable screen addition
- **Build verification** confirms all components compile successfully
- Material 3 theme provides solid foundation for all UI components
