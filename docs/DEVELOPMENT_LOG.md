4. ‚úÖ **Gemma3nEngine.kt MediaPipe API Resolution**:
   - **Issue**: Unresolved references to `setTemperature`, `setDelegate`, `setUseGpuDelegate`
   - **Research**: Extensive Perplexity research on MediaPipe Tasks GenAI 0.10.24 API
   - **Solution**: Simplified to basic `setModelPath()` configuration only
   - **Impact**: Functional AI engine ready for model loading (GPU features pending)

5. ‚úÖ **Hilt Dependency Injection Fix**:
   - **Issue**: Circular dependency with DataStore injection in multiple services
   - **Solution**: Added proper DataStore provider in AppModule with preferencesDataStore
   - **Impact**: Clean DI resolution, eliminated Hilt compilation errors

6. ‚úÖ **Build Performance Optimization**:
   - **Before**: 13+ minute build times with frequent failures
   - **After**: 2m 53s successful builds
   - **Cause**: Resolved dependency conflicts and compilation errors

#### Build Status: ‚úÖ BUILD SUCCESSFUL

**Final Build Results:**

- **Kotlin Compilation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (with minor warnings about annotation targets)
- **Hilt Java Compilation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **APK Generation**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Build Time**: 2m 53s
- **APK Size**: ~27-30MB (estimated)

#### Technical Architecture Status:

**‚úÖ Working Components:**

- Complete UI layer with Material 3 compliance
- Navigation system with proper parameter passing
- Hilt dependency injection with clean separation
- Basic MediaPipe AI engine integration
- DataStore preferences management
- Chat system end-to-end integration

**‚è∏Ô∏è Pending Enhancements:**

- Advanced MediaPipe GPU delegation (API research needed)
- Phase 3 ViewModel-Repository integration
- Missing ViewModels (Lesson, Quiz, Settings, Profile)
- Production error handling and loading states

#### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Conservative AI Approach**: Prioritized working build over advanced features
2. **Standard Android Patterns**: Replaced experimental libraries with stable approaches
3. **Incremental Research**: Used Perplexity for real-time API verification
4. **Systematic Debugging**: Addressed errors sequentially rather than guessing

#### Next Steps Priority:

1. **Test AI Integration**: Verify model loading works on device
2. **Complete Missing ViewModels**: LessonViewModel, QuizViewModel, etc.
3. **Research Advanced MediaPipe**: GPU delegation and performance parameters
4. **Production Hardening**: Error handling, loading states, edge cases

#### Key Learnings:

- **Research-First Approach**: Perplexity research prevented incorrect implementations
- **Build System Priority**: Stable builds enable rapid iteration
- **API Verification**: Documentation doesn't always match actual library APIs
- **Incremental Problem Solving**: Sequential fixes more effective than bulk changes
- **Architecture Debt Management**: Early fixes prevent exponential complexity
