# Katalis

**An offline-first, on-device AI tutor for GCE students in low-connectivity environments.**

Katalis is an open-source project dedicated to democratizing education by providing a world-class, personal mentor on the Android devices that students already own. Our mission is to ensure that academic potential is limited only by curiosity, not by circumstances.

##  Core Mission & Principles

This project was born from the lived experience of struggling to access online educational resources in Cameroon. Our entire architecture is built to solve this specific problem.

- **100% Offline-First:** Every core learning feature works without an internet connection after a one-time setup.
- **On-Device Intelligence:** Using Google's Gemma 3n, all AI processing happens on the device, ensuring zero data costs and complete student privacy.
- **Empathetic & Performant:** A clean, encouraging, and intuitive user interface designed to build confidence, even on budget hardware.

##  Key Features

- **Structured Learning Paths:** Guided curriculum based on the official GCE syllabus.
- **AI-Powered Socratic Tutoring:** An interactive chat mentor that guides students to answers instead of just providing them.
- **"Smarter RAG" Architecture:** Our AI is enriched with insights from official GCE examiner reports to understand *why* students struggle with specific topics.
- **Exam Question Bank:** Practice with real past GCE questions, complete with step-by-step solutions and examiner notes.
